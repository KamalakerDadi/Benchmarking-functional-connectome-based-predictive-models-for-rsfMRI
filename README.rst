# Benchmarking models for rsfMRI

This repository contains necessary scripts required for predictions on multiple datasets: COBRE, ADNI, ADNIDOD, ACPI, ABIDE, HCP.

Each dataset folder contains self-explanatory script starting with timeseries signals in csvs. For convenient, we uploaded only the timeseries signals on Open Science Framework but not phenotypic or behavioral information.

Subject ids are assigned to each csvs to make it easily understandable the phenotypic information associated with each subject id.

As a first step, these timeseries signals needs to be downloaded to run the scripts and corresponding phenotypic needs to be accessed from datasets website. 

Instructions to download timeseries are explained in the prediction script in each dataset folder.
